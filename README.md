# Team Beacon ✨

*Illuminating the path from raw data to delivery excellence.*

**Team Beacon** orchestrates team workflows and generates high-fidelity insights using AI. 

By leveraging Jira as a data source and Python for deep-dive preprocessing, Beacon provides the **"Signal"** within the noise. It utilizes **Cline** workflows to generate artifacts that augment the team through three distinct guiding lights:

- 🔦 **The Tactical Signal (Scrum Master) Focus**: The Now. Empowers the team to manage the sprint by surfacing daily progress trends, scope creep, and potential blockers.

- 🕯️ **The Strategic Signal (Agile Coach) Focus**: The How. Guides long-term growth by tracking health metrics, refining engineering practices, and evolving the team's work culture.

- 🔭 **The Operational Signal (Delivery Manager) Focus**: The Big Picture. Helps the team see the broader landscape and achieve milestones by overseeing multiple initiatives.
